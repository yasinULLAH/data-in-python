# Social Media Post Performance Analysis

Welcome to the Social Media Post Performance Analysis project! This project analyzes the performance of different categories of social media posts on Twitter to help clients optimize their social media strategies and increase engagement. By collecting, cleaning, and analyzing tweets, this tool provides valuable insights that allow for data-driven recommendations.

## Project Objectives

- **Increase client reach and engagement**: Analyze key performance metrics (likes, retweets, sentiment) of various categories of posts.
- **Gain valuable insights**: Use the data to improve clients' social media performance.
- **Achieve social media goals**: Make recommendations to clients for post optimization.

## Project Structure

This project uses Python to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize tweet data from different categories, such as fitness, tech, family, and food. The following tasks are performed:

- **Data Collection**: Using the Twitter API to gather tweets related to specific categories.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary elements (hashtags, mentions, URLs) from the tweet text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment of tweets using TextBlob.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the insights through bar plots and summarizing the average retweets, likes, sentiment, and tweet count for each category.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yasinULLAH/data-in-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd data-in-python
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

To run the project, you will need to set up your Twitter API credentials.

1. Sign up on [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com) and create a new app to get your API keys.
2. Add your API keys to the script by replacing the placeholders in the following section:

```python
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
API_SECRET = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
ACCESS_SECRET = 'YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET'
```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize the tweets:

```bash
python social_media_analysis.py
```

2. The script will generate visualizations showing the average engagement and sentiment for different categories of social media posts.

## Features

- **Category-based tweet analysis**: Analyze tweets in categories like fitness, tech, family, and food.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate the polarity of tweets to understand public sentiment.
